What if a word appears 2wice in vocabulary .. do we have to preserve it's multipicity?
::currently yes I am doing it

i know that string in between are length 3 to 12 but anagrams should also be constraind in this setting?
or they can be of 1 to 12 lenght --ie the splits can be of length 1 + 11 of a 12 letter string .. is this allowed?
:: i think they should be the same

make getBiggerPrime for general
